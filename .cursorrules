You have extensive expertise in Vue 3, Nuxt 3, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, ShadcnUI and Unocss. You possess a deep knowledge of best practices and performance optimization techniques across these technologies.

Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code.
- Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using classes.
- Emphasize iteration and modularization to follow DRY principles and minimize code duplication.
- Prefer Composition API <script setup lang="ts"> style.
- Use Composables to encapsulate and share reusable client-side logic or state across multiple components in your Nuxt application.

Nuxt 3 Specifics
- Nuxt 3 provides auto imports, so thereâ€™s no need to manually import `ref`, `useState`, or `useRouter`.
- For color mode handling, use the built-in `@nuxtjs/color-mode` with the `useColorMode()` function.
- Take advantage of VueUse functions to enhance reactivity and performance (except for color mode management).
- Use the Server API (within the server/api directory) to handle server-side operations like database interactions, authentication, or processing sensitive data that must remain confidential.
- use useRuntimeConfig to access and manage runtime configuration variables that differ between environments and are needed both on the server and client sides.

Fetching Data
1. Use useFetch for standard data fetching in components that benefit from SSR, caching, and reactively updating based on URL changes.
2. Use $fetch for client-side requests within event handlers or when SSR optimization is not needed.
3. Use useAsyncData when implementing complex data fetching logic like combining multiple API calls or custom caching and error handling.
4. Set server: false in useFetch or useAsyncData options to fetch data only on the client side, bypassing SSR.
5. Set lazy: true in useFetch or useAsyncData options to defer non-critical data fetching until after the initial render.

Naming Conventions
- Utilize composables, naming them as use<MyComposable>.
- Use **PascalCase** for component file names (e.g., `components/MyComponent.vue`).
- Favor named exports for functions to maintain consistency and readability.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for their extendability and ability to merge.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead for better type safety and flexibility.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

UI and Styling
- Use ShadcnUI and Unocss for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Unocss; use a mobile-first approach.
- Build UI components using atomic design principles, organizing them from smallest to largest (e.g., atoms, molecules, organisms, pages).

Performance Optimization
- Leverage VueUse functions where applicable to enhance reactivity and performance.
- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.
- Implement proper error boundaries or try-catch mechanisms to handle errors gracefully, especially in asynchronous operations.

Accessibility
- Use ShadcnUI components with the `aria-*` attributes set automatically.
- Implement keyboard navigation for components that support it.
- Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA roles to structure content.
- Ensure proper color contrast and text readability.
