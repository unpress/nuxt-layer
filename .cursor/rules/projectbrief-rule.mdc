# Project Brief Rule

The [projectbrief.md](mdc:memory-bank/projectbrief.md) file is the foundation of all project documentation. It defines the core requirements, goals, and scope, serving as the source of truth for project direction and decision-making. All other Memory Bank files build upon the context established here.
